# Movie Buff

For this project you will be writing ActiveRecord queries against the the actors, movies, and castings tables from the SQL Zoo project. We've written rspec tests to check that you both return the correct results and query the database the correct number of times. Please run them to check your work.

It may be helpful to refer to the SQL Zoo solutions for guidance as you work through these problems. Also make sure to reference the past Active Record readings as well as the ActiveRecord docs.

## Learning Goals

- Be able to write complicated ActiveRecord queries
- Become familiar with more of ActiveRecord's functionalities
- Know how to test and debug ActiveRecord queries
