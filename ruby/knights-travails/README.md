# Knight's Travails

In this project we will create a class that will find the shortest path for a Chess Knight from a starting position to an end position. Both the start and end positions should be on a standard 8x8 chess board.

## Learning Goals

- Be able to implement your PolyTreeNode to build a path from start to finish
- Know how to store and traverse a tree
- Know when and why to use BFS vs. DFS
